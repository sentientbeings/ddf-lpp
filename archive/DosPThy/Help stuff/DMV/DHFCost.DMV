    This screen is a figment of your imagination; you cannot be reading it. It is the help screen telling you how to set fixed cost in the demand module--where you never have a chance to set fixed cost, since you are interested in value to the consumer not cost to the producer. Hence it does not exist and cannot be appearing. I recommend that you take a rest.    On second thought, write me a letter (David Friedman, U of C Law School,  1111 E. 60th St., Chicago, IL 60637) to tell me how you got to this screen. If the answer is that you have been wasting your time using a word processor to read all my help screens, don't bother writing.                              (End of Help Screen)
