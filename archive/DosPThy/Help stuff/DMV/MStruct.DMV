    These instructions give an overview of the section of this program that you are now in--the monopoly module. You got to them by pressing F1 (HELP) and then selecting instructions (1). If, after you finish reading these instructions, you want more detailed information on the part of the module you are currently in, press F1 (HELP) again and this time select Help (2).    If, on the other hand, you want more general information, press F2 (MENU), select "Start Over" (2), then press F1 (HELP) and select `Instructions' (1). "Start Over" will put you back at the beginning of the program, before any module has been selected, so the instructions you will get will be a general overview of the whole program.                                   Monopoly    The third module lets you explore the way in which a single-price monopoly chooses the price/quantity combination that maximizes its profit; the corresponding discussion in the text is in the first part of Chapter 10. The individual or firm of the first two modules observed what the market price was and decided how much to consume or produce at that price. Since the industry was assumed to be competitive, the amount bought or sold by one individual or firm had no significant effect on the price. That is not the case here. The firm we are analyzing is a price-seeker--the amount it sells will determine the price at which it sells.    To analyze the behavior of such a firm, you must first draw a demand curve, showing how the quantity it can sell varies with the price it charges, and a marginal cost curve, showing the cost of producing one more unit as a function of the number of units being produced. You must also choose a value for the firm's fixed cost. You can then adjust quantity, using the left cursor key to move it left (decrease quantity) and the right cursor key to move it right (or, if you have a mouse, using the cursor and the left mouse button to drag the quantity line left or right). As you do so, the price changes; an increase in quantity lowers price and a decrease raises it. Your objective is to find the price that maximizes the firm's profit, since that is what the firm is trying to do. When you have found that quantity, you press Enter (or the right mouse button); the program will mark both the price and the marginal cost at that quantity. You cannot, as in the previous cases, try again for different prices, since quantity and price determine each other. You can, however, try different marginal cost curves and different values of fixed cost in order to learn how much a monopoly facing the demand curve you have drawn would produce under different (cost) conditions.    When you are finished with that demand curve, the computer will show you the points you have found and the marginal revenue curve implied by your demand curve. Since a monopoly maximizes its profit by producing a quantity for which marginal cost equals marginal revenue, the MC/Quantity points you have chosen (shown as large X's) should lie approximately on the marginal revenue curve. An exception occurs if the monopoly cannot cover its costs at any quantity, in which case its optimal quantity is zero. So all your X's should lie either on the MR curve or on the vertical axis.                              (End of Instructions)
