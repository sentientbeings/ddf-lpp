    A demand curve shows, for any price, the quantity bought. A rational consumer, faced with the opportunity to buy as much of a good as he wants at some price, chooses the quantity that makes him as well off as possible. So one finds a point on a demand curve by picking a price (as you have just done) and finding the quantity that maximizes net benefit.    Quantity is shown on the screen as a vertical line. The net benefit a consumer gets by consuming that quantity is a positive area (units for which MV is greater than price, hence each unit is worth more than it costs) minus a negative area (MV less than price, each unit worth less than it costs). The program fills in the corresponding regions with + signs and - signs (or blue ink and red ink if you have color) and shows net benefit as a number in a box near the left edge of the screen.     Your objective at this point is to find the quantity that maximizes net benefit. To increase quantity, press the right cursor key (the one with a small arrow pointing right); the vertical line will move right. To decrease quantity, press the left cursor key; the line will move left. If you have a mouse, you can also adjust quantity by putting the cursor on one side or the other of the vertical line and pressing the left mouse button, pulling the line towards the cursor. Whenever you stop moving the line, the program redraws the + and - areas and recalculates net benefit. Keep changing quantity until you find the highest value of net benefit. Tell the computer that you are done by pressing the Enter key (or the right mouse button). It will ask if you are sure; either strike "n" and try more values of quantity or "y" and go on to the next part of the program.                              (End of Help screen)
