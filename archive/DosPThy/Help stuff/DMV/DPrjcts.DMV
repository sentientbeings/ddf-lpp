                                   Demand    The first thing to do with the demand module of this program is to satisfy yourself that, for the straight line marginal value curves discussed in Chapter 4, the marginal value curve and the demand curve are identical. In the process of doing so, you should also see why. The purpose of this part of the program is not to tell you the answer--that is already in the book--but to help you intuit why the answer is true.    The next step is to try drawing other MV curves. There are two ways in which you can figure out for yourself whether the same relation holds for them--by thinking through the logic of the argument and by using the program to find points on the demand curve. Whichever you do, check your conclusion by drawing the demand curve and seeing whether or not the computer agrees with you.    If you find that for all the marginal value curves you draw, MV is identical to D, your next project is to try to find some MV curve for which it is not.    If you succeed in that, your final project is to work out, in general, for what sorts of marginal value curves MV=D, for what sorts it does not, and, in the latter case, how to deduce D from MV.                            (End of Demand Projects)
