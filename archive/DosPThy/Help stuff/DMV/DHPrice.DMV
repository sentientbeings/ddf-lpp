    A demand curve shows, for any price, how much of a good a consumer chooses to buy if he is free to buy as much as he wants at that price. You are currently choosing a price in order to find a point on a demand curve--the point showing what quantity a consumer would buy if he could buy as much as he wished at that price.    The price is shown on the screen as a horizontal line. The line represents the situation of a consumer on a competitive market; he can buy as much as he wishes without affecting the price. A more complicated price line could be used to describe the situation of a monopsonist (Chapter 10) or a consumer facing a multi-part price, such as "twenty cents each, six for a dollar."     You can adjust the price by using the up and down cursor keys (the ones with little arrows pointing up and down). If you have a mouse, you can also adjust it by putting the cursor above or below the price line and pressing the left mouse button to pull the line up or down. When you have the price you want, press the Enter key (or the right mouse button) and the program will go on to the next step.                              (End of Help Screen)
