    These instructions give an overview of the section of this program that you are now in--the supply module. You got to them by pressing F1 (HELP) and then selecting instructions (1). If, after you finish reading these instructions, you want more detailed information on the part of the module you are currently in, press F1 (HELP) again and this time select Help (2).    If, on the other hand, you want more general information, press F2 (MENU), select "Start Over" (2), then press F1 (HELP) and select "Instructions" (1). "Start Over" will put you back at the beginning of the program, before any module has been selected, so the instructions you will get will be a general overview of the whole program.                                      Supply    The supply module explores the relation between the cost curves of a firm in a competitive industry and its supply curve; the corresponding material in the textbook is in Chapter 9, although the same concepts appear, in a simpler and somewhat less explicit form, in Chapter 5.    The first step in exploring the relation between a marginal cost curve and a supply curve is to draw a marginal cost curve. The program lets you draw it either as a straight line or freehand. To do the former, you select "straight" (by striking 1 after selecting the supply module); to do the latter you select "curved" (2).    To draw a straight line, you first move the cursor (the little arrow on the screen) to the height at which you want the line to start. You move the cursor on the screen by using the cursor keys or the mouse (if you have a mouse). When the cursor is at the height you want (it does not matter where it is in the horizontal direction at this point) you press shift or the left mouse button and a dotted line appears, running from the cursor to the vertical axis. As you move the cursor (holding down shift or the button) the left end of the line stays fixed but the right end follows the cursor. When you have the line the way you want it, press Enter (or the right mouse button) and it will turn into a solid line. You have now finished drawing the marginal cost curve and can proceed to deduce the supply curve from it.    To draw a curved line (after selecting "curved" by typing 2 when the computer asks which you want to draw), you again move the cursor to the height at which you want the marginal value curve to start and press shift or the left mouse button. As long as you hold shift or the button down, the curve will grow from its starting point (on the vertical axis) towards your cursor; if you release shift or the button the curve stops growing. You can then move the cursor somewhere else, press again, and the curve will grow towards the new position of the cursor. The curve always grows from left to right; if you move the cursor to the left of the end of the curve and press shift, nothing happens.    If you move the cursor while shift or the button is down, the curve follows the cursor. The easiest way to do this, if you do not have a mouse, is to use the Caps Lock key to lock the shift key down, then use it again to release the shift key when you want to stop dragging the curve. When you have finished drawing the curve to your satisfaction, use Enter or the right mouse button to tell the program you are done.    The process of deducing a supply curve from a marginal cost curve in this module is very much like the process of deducing a demand curve from a marginal value curve in the demand module. One difference is that in order to deduce the supply curve you need to know the fixed cost as well as the marginal cost curve. After you have drawn the marginal cost curve, the program will prompt you to set fixed cost. FC appears in a box at the lower left edge of the screen. It starts at 0; you can scroll it up by using the up cursor key or down by using the down key. When you have the value of FC that you want, press Enter.    Just as with the Demand module, the supply module lets you pick a price (using the up and down cursor keys, or the mouse and the left mouse button, to adjust it up or down) then adjust quantity (using the left and right cursor keys to move it left or right, or using the left mouse button to drag it towards the cursor). Your objective is to maximize the profit of the firm whose marginal cost curve you have drawn. Since firms try to maximize their profits, the point you find--the quantity that maximizes the firm's profit for a given price--should be the amount the firm would produce at that price. If so, it is a point on the supply curve, since the supply curve shows, for each price, how much a firm that could sell all it wanted at that price (and nothing at any higher price) would choose to produce.    Profit is equal to the area of a region of positive profit (units whose marginal cost is more than the price they can be sold for) minus the area of a region of negative profit (units whose marginal cost is less than price) minus fixed cost. Fixed cost is only incurred if the firm chooses to produce; it has the alternative of closing down (or not going into business in the first place), in which case profit is zero. So the program shows profit equal to zero for quantity equal to zero. That is one difference between fixed cost and sunk cost, which you will encounter in Chapter 13--two kinds of cost often confused by students (and sometimes by textbooks). For all other quantities, the program shows the region of positive profit filled in with + signs (or painted in blue ink) and the region of negative profit filled in with - signs (red ink).     For reasons explained in Chapter 9, the average cost curve of the firm is useful in deducing its supply curve. After you have drawn the supply curve the program allows you, if you wish, to see the average cost curve. In the process of finding points on the supply curve you should have already deduced the significant fact (for your present purposes) about the average cost curve; seeing the average cost curve lets you check whether you have done so correctly. Just as in the demand module, the program tells you whether you have drawn the curve correctly. If you have not, you get a chance to try again or to plot additional points.    The relationship between MC and S, like that between MV and D, can be complicated. The complications are mentioned in Chapter 9 but not explored in any detail. This module allows you, if you wish, to work out the supply curves implied by marginal cost curves more complicated than those analyzed in the chapter.                               (End of Instructions)
