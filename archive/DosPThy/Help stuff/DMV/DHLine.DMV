    You draw a straight line marginal value curve on the screen by using the cursor keys (or the mouse) to move the cursor and the shift key (or left mouse button) to draw and move the line.     All of the lines drawn in this program start on the vertical axis. You start the line by moving the cursor to the height where you want the line to start, then pressing shift (or the left mouse button). A dotted line appears, running horizontally from the point of the cursor (which is shaped like an arrow) to the vertical axis. You can move the cursor while holding down shift, most easily done by using the Caps Lock key to lock shift down, or while holding down the left mouse button. The right end of the line will follow the cursor. Or you can release shift (or the mouse button), move the cursor, then press it again--at which point the end of the line jumps from where the cursor was to where it is. When you have the right end where you want it press Enter (or the right mouse button).The line will become solid and the program will move on to the next step.                              (End of Help Screen)
