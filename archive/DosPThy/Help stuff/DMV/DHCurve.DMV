    You can draw a marginal value curve in this program by using the cursor keys (or the mouse if you have one) to move the cursor around and the shift key (or left mouse button) to drag the line in the direction of the cursor. All curves start at the vertical axis, so the first step is to move the cursor to the height where you want the curve to start. Press shift (or the left mouse button) and the curve will start growing from the axis towards the cursor. The farther the cursor is from the end of the curve, the faster the curve will grow, so if you want to guide it precisely you may want to start with the cursor fairly close to the axis.    As long as you hold down shift (or the mouse button), the curve will grow towards the cursor; if you release it, the curve stops growing. You can then move the cursor and press shift again; the curve will start growing towards the new position.    You can also move the cursor while holding shift down; the curve will follow the cursor across the screen. This may work better if, instead of holding down shift, you press Shift Lock, which in effect locks down the shift key. To release it, press Shift Lock again.    You can only draw the marginal value curve from left to right; if you try moving the cursor behind (to the left of) the end of the line you are drawing, the line will stop growing. The reason for this is that if marginal value doubles back--goes first left to right then right to left--there will be some quantities for which MV has two different values! That is impossible; marginal value is a function of quantity, so if you know the quantity consumed, you know the marginal value of one more unit.    When you have finished drawing the curve, press Enter (or the right mouse button).                                (End of Help Screen)
