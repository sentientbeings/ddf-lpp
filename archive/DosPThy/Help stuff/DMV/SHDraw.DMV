    The final step in this module of the program is to draw the supply curve implied by the marginal cost curve that you drew at the beginning of the module. The program helps you to draw the curve by showing the marginal cost curve and the points on the supply curve that you found. Using that information, you should be able to draw in the entire supply curve.      You draw the curve by using the cursor keys (or the mouse if you have one) to move the cursor around and the shift key (or left mouse button) to drag the line in the direction of the cursor. All curves start at the vertical axis, so the first step is to move the cursor until it is at the height at which you want the curve to start. Press shift (or the left mouse button) and the curve starts growing from the vertical axis towards the cursor. The farther the cursor is from the end of the curve, the faster the curve will grow, so if you want to guide it precisely you may want to start with the cursor close to the vertical axis.    As long as you hold down shift (or the mouse button), the curve will grow  towards the cursor; if you release it, the curve stops growing. You can then  move the cursor and press shift again; the curve will start growing towards  the new position.    You can also move the cursor while holding shift down; the curve will  follow the cursor across the screen. This may work better if, instead of  holding down shift, you press Shift Lock, which in effect locks down the shift  key. To release it, press Shift Lock again.    When you have finished drawing the curve, strike Enter (or press the right mouse  button).                                (End of Help screen)
