    The program now shows you the marginal revenue curve for the demand curve that you drew. It also shows, for each time you found a profit-maximizing quantity, two points. One point is the combination of price and quantity that, according to you, the monopoly would choose. The other point, marked with a large X, shows marginal cost at that quantity.    If a monopoly produces at all, it produces a quantity for which marginal cost is equal to marginal revenue. So if you have found the correct quantity for each marginal cost curve you drew, the X's should lie along the MR curve--provided the monopoly chooses to produce something. If it does not, quantity is zero, so the X should be on the vertical axis. By looking at the points you have drawn and the marginal revenue curve, you can see whether you selected the correct quantity for each marginal cost curve you drew.                              (End of Help Screen)
