    You have just demonstrated that you are a human being, not a tape recorder. In order to do this problem correctly, you had to figure out for yourself something that was not explained anywhere in the text--the relation between the demand curve and the marginal value curve when the latter is not both monotonic and negatively sloped. You also had to contemplate the dreadful thought that something in the textbook might not be entirely true.    If you are ever in the same city I am (currently Chicago), look me up and I will buy you an ice cream cone.                                         David Friedman                                         University of Chicago Law School                                         1111 E. 60th St.                                         Chicago, IL 60637Note: This offer--and the preceding message--do not apply if you got to this screen by going through the help screens with a word processor, being told the solution by another student, or any method other than figuring out the demand curve implied by a marginal value curve that was not monotonic down.   (End of Congratulations Message, Free Cone Offer, and Curmudgeonly Note)
