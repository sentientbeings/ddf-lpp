    The first step in the demand module is to draw a marginal value curve. A marginal value curve shows, for any quantity of a good, the value to the consumer of having one more unit of that good. You may choose to draw a straight line marginal value curve by striking the number 1 on the keyboard or a curved marginal value curve by striking the number 2 on the keyboard. These are the numbers 1 and 2 (located in the top row of the main group of keys on the keyboard) not the function keys F1 and F2.                              (End of Help Screen)
