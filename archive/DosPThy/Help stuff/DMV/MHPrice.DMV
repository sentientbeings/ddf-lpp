    You have chosen to have marginal cost constant, so the MC curve will be a horizontal line. The computer has put the MC curve on the screen; you can adjust it up and down using the up and down cursor keys (the ones with little arrows pointing up and down). If you have a mouse, you can also adjust it by putting the cursor above or below the MC line and pressing the left mouse button to pull the line up or down. When you have the MC you want, press the Enter key (or the right mouse button).                               (End of Help Screen)
