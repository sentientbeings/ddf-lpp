    This module is designed to let you find points on the demand curve implied by a particular marginal value curve. You find each point by setting a price and then finding the quantity that maximizes net benefit for that price. Your mission is to locate enough points to figure out what the demand curve looks like and draw it. If you think you have enough points now, then answer yes (by striking the "y" key on the keyboard). If you want to find some more points before you try to draw in the entire curve, answer no ("n" key); the computer will let you change the price and find another point, then ask again whether you have enough. Feel free to keep answering no; it will take a lot of no's before the computer loses patience and insists on your going ahead and drawing the curve.                                (End of Help screen)
