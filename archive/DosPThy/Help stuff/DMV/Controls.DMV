      This program is controlled from the keyboard, using the function keys F1-F2, the number keys 1-10, the cursor keys, the shift keys, and the Enter key. If you have a mouse attached, the mouse is used instead of the cursor keys to move the cursor; the left and right mouse buttons substitute for shift and Enter.     The function keys, on an IBM PC and most compatibles, are located either at the left side of the keyboard or above the keyboard. In this program they are used to select one of the two menus (HELP and MENU).They may be used at almost any time in the program, except when you are in one of the two menus. When you have selected HELP or MENU (F1 or F2) you cannot select the other menu until you have made your selection and the computer has finished whatever you have told it to do.   The number keys, which are the top row of keys on the main part of the keyboard, are used to make selections from the two function key menus HELP and MENU and to choose among the alternatives presented at various stages of the program. Remember that if the program asks you to choose selection 1, 2, or 3 you must respond by striking a number key not a function key.    The letter keys make up the central portion of the keyboard--the part you use for typing. They are used to respond to "yes/no" questions (strike y for yes and n for no) and to respond to the message "press any letter"--which lets you decide when you want the computer to go on to the next step.    One set of cursor keys, on a PC and most compatibles, is on the numeric keypad; they are the same keys as the numbers 2,4,6, and 8. They function as cursor keys when Num Lock is off and number keys when it is on. Some compatibles have a light to show whether Num Lock is on; other computers, including the IBM PC, do not. If you find that the cursor keys are not having any effect, it may mean that Num Lock is on; if so, pressing it once will turn it off. Many computers also have a second set of cursor keys, which always work. The cursor keys are used to move the cursor (the little arrow) around the screen if you do not have a mouse; if you do have a mouse it moves the cursor (much faster and more easily). The cursor keys are also used, in this program, to to set fixed cost and, if you do not have a mouse, to move vertical lines left and right and horizontal lines up and down.    Either shift key (or the left mouse button) can be used to make the cursor do things--draw a line, for example. If you want to hold down shift while moving the cursor, it may work better if you use Caps Lock, which effectively locks down the shift key; strike Caps Lock again to release shift. The Enter Key (or the right mouse button) is used to tell the program that you have finished doing something. More detailed information on the uses of the keys and buttons will be found in the help screens for the various parts of the program; to get any such screen, you simply strike F1 (HELP) when you are in the part of the program you want to know about, then select alternative 2 (Help).                                  (End of Controls)
