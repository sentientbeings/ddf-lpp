    A monopoly, unlike a firm in a competitive industry, is a "price-seeker. The quantity it produces determines the price at which it can sell its output, so instead of observing a market price and choosing a quantity, it observes a demand curve and chooses a quantity/price combination. In order to increase the quantity it sells, it must lower its price; if it raises its price it will reduce the quantity it sells. Its objective is to maximize its profit. To find out how much it will produce, you vary the quantity and observe the resulting profit; when you have found the quantity for which profit is highest you have found the quantity that the monopoly will choose to produce.      At any quantity, the monopoly's profit is total revenue (price times quantity) minus total cost. This can be represented as the area of the regions for which marginal cost is below price, representing units sold for more than it costs the monopoly to produce them, minus the area of the regions where marginal cost is above price, minus the fixed cost. The program lets you choose quantity; it draws the corresponding price. It also fills in the positive and negative areas with + signs and - signs (blue ink and red ink if you are running the program in color) and shows profit as a number in a box near the left edge of the screen.     Your objective, at this point, is to find the quantity that maximizes profit. To increase quantity, press the right cursor key (the one with a small arrow pointing right); the vertical line will move right. To decrease quantity, press the left cursor key; the line will move left. If you have a mouse you can also adjust quantity by putting the cursor on one side or the other of the vertical line and pressing the left mouse button, pulling the line towards the cursor. Whenever you stop moving the line, the program redraws the + and - areas and recalculates profit. Keep changing quantity until you find the highest value of profit. Tell the computer that you are done by pressing the Enter key (or the right mouse button). It will ask if you are sure; either strike "n" and try more values of quantity or "y" and go on to the next part of the program.                              (End of Help screen)
