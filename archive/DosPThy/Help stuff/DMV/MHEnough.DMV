    This module is designed to let you explore the relationship between the demand curve faced by a (single price) monopoly, its cost curves, and the quantity it chooses to produce. You first choose everything except quantity  (draw a demand curve and a marginal cost curve, and choose a value for fixed cost) then find the quantity that maximizes profit.    After you have found the quantity that you think maximizes profit, you may go on to see whether the quantity/marginal cost combination you have chosen is, as it should be, on the marginal revenue curve. Or you can redo the calculation several times for different marginal cost curves and/or different values of fixed cost. Either way, if you have found all the points you want and are ready to look at your points and the marginal revenue curve, answer yes (by striking the "y" key on the keyboard). If you want to find some more points, using different values of FC or different marginal cost curves, answer no ("n"). After you have found another profit maximizing quantity, the computer will again ask whether you have found enough. Feel free to keep answering no; it will take a lot of no's before the computer loses patience and insists on showing you the marginal revenue curve whether or not you are ready to see it.                                (End of Help screen)
