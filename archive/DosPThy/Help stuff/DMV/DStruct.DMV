    These instructions give an overview of the section of this program that you are now in--the demand module. You got to them by pressing F1 (HELP) and then selecting instructions (1). If, after you finish reading these instructions, you want more detailed information on the part of the module you are currently in, press F1 (HELP) again and this time select Help (2).    If, on the other hand, you want more general information, press F1 (MENU), select "Start Over" (2), then press F1 (HELP) and select `Instructions' (1). "Start Over" will put you back at the beginning of the program, before any module has been selected, so the instructions you will get will be a general overview of the whole program.                                Demand    The purpose of the Demand module is to let you explore for yourself how a demand curve is related to a marginal value curve. The marginal value curve, as you should remember from Chapter 4, describes the value to an individual of consuming one more unit of something as a function of how many units he is already consuming; typically (but not inevitably) marginal value falls as quantity increases. A demand curve describes the quantity of something that an individual will consume as a function of the price he must pay for it.    The relation between MV and D is explained in Chapter 4. I wrote this program after observing that many students who had read Chapter 4 thought they understood why the two were related--and were wrong. I concluded that it is the sort of thing that is easier to understand in pictures than in words, easier to understand in moving pictures than in still pictures, and easiest of all in moving pictures moved by the person who is trying to understand it. Hence this program.    The first step in exploring the relation between a marginal value curve and a demand curve is to draw a marginal value curve. The program lets you draw it either as a straight line or freehand. After selecting the demand module and being asked whether you want MV straight or curved, select "straight" by typing 1 or "curved" by typing 2.    To draw a straight line, you first move the cursor (the little arrow on the screen) to the height at which you want the line to start. You move the cursor by using the cursor keys, or by using a mouse if you have one. When the cursor is at the height you want (it does not matter where it is in the horizontal direction at this point) press shift (or the left mouse button); a dotted line appears, running from the cursor to the vertical axis. As you move the cursor with shift or the mouse button held down, the left end of the line stays fixed but the right follows the cursor. When you have the line where you want it, strike Enter (or press the right mouse button) and it will turn into a solid line. You have now finished drawing a straight-line marginal value curve.    If you want to draw a curved line for marginal value instead (after selecting "curved" by typing 2 when the computer asks which you want to draw), you also start by putting the cursor at the height where you want the marginal value curve to start and pressing shift or the left mouse button. As long as you hold shift or the button down, the curve will grow towards your cursor; if you release shift or the button the curve stops growing. You can then move the cursor somewhere else, press again, and the curve will grow towards the new position of the cursor. The curve always grows from left to right; if you move the cursor to the left of the end of the curve and press shift, nothing happens.    If you move the cursor while shift or the button is down, the curve follows the cursor. The easiest way to do this, if you do not have a mouse, is to use the Caps Lock key to lock the shift key down then use it again to release the shift key when you want to stop dragging the curve. When you have finished drawing the curve to your satisfaction, use Enter or the right mouse button to tell the program you are done.    Once you have drawn the MV curve, either straight or curved, the next step is to use it to find a series of points on the demand curve. A point on the demand curve represents the quantity (horizontal coordinate) that you would buy at a price (vertical coordinate). So to find one point, you pick a price and then find the quantity that, at that price, maximizes your net benefit from buying and consuming the good--the value to you of what you get minus the value of what you pay for it.    When you have finished your MV curve, a horizontal line representing price appears on the screen. You can move it up or down by using the up and down cursor keys or drag it up and down using the cursor and the left mouse button (if you have a mouse). When the price line is at the price for which you wish to find quantity--the height of the point on the demand curve you are looking for--press Enter or the right mouse button.    The next step is to find the quantity you would buy at that price. The program will leave the horizontal price line that you have chosen on the screen, and add a vertical line for quantity. It will then show your net benefit from buying that quantity of the good at that price by filling in the region for which marginal value is greater than price with + signs (blue ink if you have color), representing the net gain from buying and consuming units of the good that are worth more to you than they cost. It will fill in the region for which marginal value is less than price with - signs (red ink), representing the net loss from buying and consuming units that cost you more than they are worth to you. The positive area minus the negative area--the gain minus the loss--is your net benefit from buying that quantity at that price; it is shown in a box at the left side of the screen. It is your consumer surplus (Chapter 4).    In deciding how much of a good to consume, your objective is to pick the quantity that maximizes your net benefit. You can adjust the quantity by using the right and left cursor keys to move the quantity line right or left (or dragging it with the cursor and left mouse button). Each time you finish moving it and let the key up, the computer will redraw the regions of + and - signs and recalculate your net benefit. When you have the quantity that you think maximizes net benefit, press Enter (or the right mouse button).    The computer will ask you to confirm that that quantity maximizes net benefit; if you change your mind (or pressed Enter by mistake) you can type "n" and adjust quantity some more. If you think you have the right quantity, press "y." The computer will mark the price/quantity point you have selected on the screen. Since that point shows the quantity you would consume at that price, it is (or should be--you may have made a mistake) one point on the demand curve.     The computer will ask whether you want to find more points. If you answer yes ("y") it will give you a chance to choose a new price and repeat the process of finding an optimum quantity, giving you another point on D.    You should continuing trying different prices and finding different points on the demand curve until you believe you have enough points to tell you what the demand curve looks like. When you do, answer the computers question ("Do you think you have enough points") with "y." The computer will then clear the screen, draw in your points, and redraw the marginal value curve. You then draw the demand curve, using the cursor keys and shift (or the mouse and the left mouse button) just as you did in drawing the (curved) MV curve. When you are satisfied, press Enter or the right mouse button. The program will tell you whether you have gotten the curve right. If so, you have finished the demand module. You may do it over again with another demand curve, or try one of the other two, or quit or change programs. If you do not have it right, the program gives you the option of either trying to draw it again or going back and finding some more points. You can continue trying to find the demand curve until you either succeed or decide to give up and do something else.    One final hint. The relationship between MV and D is more complicated than Chapter 4 says it is; one of the purposes of this module is to let you discover the addtional complications for yourself by experimenting with more complicated MV curves than the ones discussed in the book. If you think you have the correct demand curve and the program says you do not, it is probably right; stop and think about what a demand curve is and whether what you have drawn could be a demand curve.                            (The End of Instructions)
