    A supply curve shows, for any price, the quantity a firm will choose to produce and sell at that price. A firm that can sell as much as it wants at a price, produces and sells that quantity for which its profit is maximized. So one finds a point on a supply curve by picking a price (as you have just done) and finding the quantity that maximizes profit.    Quantity is shown on the screen as a vertical line. The profit that a firm makes by producing that quantity equals a positive area (units for which MC is less than price, so each unit sells for more than it costs to produce) minus a negative area (MC greater than price: each unit sells for less than it costs) minus fixed cost. The program shades in the corresponding areas with + signs and - signs (or blue ink and red ink if you are running the program in color) and shows profit as a number in a box near the left edge of the screen.     Your objective, at this point, is to find the quantity that maximizes profit. To increase quantity, press the right cursor key (the one with a small arrow pointing right); the vertical line will move right. To decrease quantity, press the left cursor key; the line will move left. If you have a mouse you can also adjust quantity by putting the cursor on one side or the other of the vertical line and pressing the left mouse button, pulling the line towards the cursor. Whenever you stop moving the line, the program redraws the + and - areas and recalculates profit. Keep changing quantity until you find the highest value of profit. Tell the computer that you are done by pressing the Enter key (or the right mouse button). It will ask if you are sure; either strike "n" and try more values of quantity or "y" and go on to the next part of the program.                                (End of Help Screen)
