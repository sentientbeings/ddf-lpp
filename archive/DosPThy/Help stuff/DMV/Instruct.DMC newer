    This program consists of three different modules, labeled "demand," "supply", and "monopoly." When the program starts, or when you have finished going through any one of the modules, you can choose which module you want to do next by typing 1 (for demand), 2 (for supply), or 3 (for monopoly). Once you have selected a module, the program will ask additional questions, such as (if you have chosen demand) whether you want to draw a straight or curved marginal value curve. As you go through the module, further instructions and questions will appear on the top of the screen, while the things you (and the computer) draw appear in the drawing area below.      At any point in any of the modules you may call up HELP or MENU by striking the function keys F1 or F2. On the standard IBM PC and most compatibles, the function keys are located either to the left of the main part of the keyboard or above it.      F1 (HELP) gives you the alternative of Instructions (1), Help (2), Controls (3) or Projects (4). Instructions gives you an overview of the module you are currently in; if you have not yet chosen any module you will get an overview of the whole program--which is what you are reading at the moment. Help gives a more detailed explanation of the particular part of the module you are currently in. Controls is an explanation of how you use the keyboard and/or the mouse to do things in the program. Projects is a brief list of suggested things to do with the module you are currently in. F2 (MENU) calls up a menu that allows you to quit the program entirely, to start it over again, or to switch to one of the other programs.     If you do not enjoy reading instructions and do enjoy playing with computers, feel free to stop reading at this point and start experimenting with the program. The most important thing to remember is that nothing you can do (short of taking an axe to the computer) does any permanent damage. If you do something wrong in the program, you can always start over again. If you cannot get the computer to do anything at all, you can press Ctrl, Alt, and Delete simultaneously, which reboots the computer--starts it over as if you had turned it off and started again. If that does not work, you can always take out the diskette, turn off the computer, walk around the room three times to relax, turn the computer back on, wait a while (if it is an IBM) while it counts its fingers to be sure they are all there, reinsert the disk, and start afresh. If you have somehow damaged the disk (by attaching it to a metal bulletin board with a magnet, for example) you can reformat it and copy the programs from some other student's disk. So be brave, and if you enjoy trial and error, try and err. You can always come back and read the instructions later.      If, on the other hand, you prefer to read the instructions, finish this set, then choose a module, then press F1 again and select instructions (1). You will be given a fairly lengthy overview of what the module does. Read it and start going through the module. If at some point you become puzzled, press F1 again and select Help (2) for a more detailed explanation.                              Final Words    I hope you enjoy the three modules of this program. If you have problems, try pressing F1 and either reading the instructions for that module, reading the description of the controls, or reading the Help screen for the part of the program you are in. If you cannot think of anything interesting to do with the program, press F1 and select "projects" for some suggestions.    If you find any bugs in the program, or if you have suggestions for improvements or additional programs, feel free to write me (David Friedman, University of Chicago Law School, 1111 E. 60th St., Chicago, IL 60637; EMail to DDFr@Midway.UChicago.Edu).    Have fun. Be brave.                                (End of Instructions)
