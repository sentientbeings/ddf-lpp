                                   Monopoly    You may want to start the monopoly module by working through the simple case described several times in Chapter 10--a monopoly with a straight line demand curve and constant marginal cost (a horizontal MC curve). Try it for several different values of MC. You should find that your MC/quantity points lie along the marginal revenue curve.    The next step is to see how the relation works out when MC is no longer constant. You can continue to use a straight line demand curve. Draw a variety of MC curves, find the profit maximizing quantity, and see if the pattern (profit is maximized at the quantity for which MR=MC) still holds.    The final step is to experiment with demand curves that are curved. You should find that the relation still holds, although MR is no longer a straight line. If you wish to learn more about the relation between a demand curve and a marginal revenue curve, you can switch to program 1 (Curvedraw), then come back to this program later.    You may find that you have drawn a demand curve whose marginal revenue curve is not monotonic--instead of going steadily down it goes down, then up, then down again. If so, marginal cost will probably intersect marginal revenue in several different places. Experiment to see which gives the highest profit. See if you can work out a general rule.    If demand is not a smooth curve, you will find that MR is no longer continuous; it may jump up (when the slope of D suddenly becomes gentler) or down (steeper). This opens up a new possibility; MC may "intersect" MR at one of the points of discontinuity, with MR jumping from below MC to above it without ever passing through it. See if you can find a case in which the profit maximizing point is sitting right in the gap.    Another project is to experiment with the effect of changing the value of FC while keeping D and MC fixed. Just as in the case of the supply module, it is interesting to try to figure out what features of the monopoly's behavior are determined by FC and what by D and MC.    If you have gotten this far, you have probably exhausted the potentialities of the program and may want to return to pen and paper to explore further the question of how a monopoly maximizes its profit when its demand and marginal cost curves are not simple straight lines.                              (End of Monopoly Projects)
