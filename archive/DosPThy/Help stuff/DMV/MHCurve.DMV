    You can draw a marginal cost curve or a demand curve in this program by using the cursor keys (or the mouse if you have one) to move the cursor around and the shift key (or left mouse button) to drag the line in the direction of the cursor. All curves start at the vertical axis, so the first step is to move the cursor to the height where you want the curve to start. Press shift (or the left mouse button) and the curve will start growing from the axis towards the cursor. The farther the cursor is from the end of the curve, the faster the curve will grow, so if you want to guide it precisely you may want to start with the cursor fairly close to the axis.     As long as you hold down shift (or the mouse button), the curve will grow towards the cursor; if you release it, the curve stops growing. You can then move the cursor and press shift again; the curve will start growing towards the new position.    You can also move the cursor while holding shift down; the curve will follow the cursor across the screen. This may work better if, instead of holding down shift, you press Shift Lock, which in effect locks down the shift key. To release it, press Shift Lock again.    You can only draw the marginal cost curve from left to right; if you try moving the cursor behind (to the left of) the end of the line you are drawing, the line will stop growing. If marginal cost doubled back--went first left to right then right to left--there would be some quantites for which MC had two different values! That is impossible; marginal cost is a function of quantity, so if you know the quantity being produced, you know the marginal cost of producing one more unit.      You can only draw the demand curve sloping down. There are two reasons for this. If the whole line slopes up we have a Giffen good, and this program does not permit monopolies to sell Giffen goods. If the line sloped up and then down, or down and then up, there would be some prices for which D had two different values. That is impossible; demand is a function of price. At a given price, there is some definite quantity that consumers will choose to buy.    When you have finished drawing the curve, press Enter (or the right mouse button).                              (End of Help Screen)
