    The first step in the monopoly module is to draw a demand curve. A demand curve shows, for any price, the quantity of the good that consumers will buy at that price. You may choose to draw a straight line demand curve by striking the number 1 on the keyboard or a curved demand curve by striking the number 2 on the keyboard. These are the numbers 1 and 2 (located in the top row of the main group of keys on the keyboard) not the function keys  F1 and F2.                              (End of Help Screen)
