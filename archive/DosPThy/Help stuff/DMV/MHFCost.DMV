    One of the things determining whether a monopoly produces anything or simply shuts down and goes out of business (or never comes into existence in the first place) is its fixed cost--the smallest expenditure that will permit it to produce anything at all. Fixed cost is shown in a box at the bottom of the left hand side of the screen. If you want to increase it, press the up cursor key (the one with a little arrow pointing up--not the PgUp key); FC will keep increasing as long as you keep the key pressed. If you want to decrease it, press the down cursor key. When you have the value of fixed cost that you want, press Enter and the computer will go on to the next step in the program.                              (End of Help Screen)
