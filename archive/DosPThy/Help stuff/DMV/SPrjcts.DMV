                                    Supply    The supply module should be used first to work out for yourself the relation between MC, AC, FC, and S explained in Chapter 9 and then to see how it applies to more complicated MC curves.  You may find it interesting to draw a marginal cost curve and derive supply curves from it for a variety of different values of FC. It should become clear fairly quickly which characteristics of the supply curve are determined by fixed cost and which by marginal cost.    The text mentions the possibility that MC and P, or MC and AC, may intersect several times. You can draw MC curves for which that happens, find out what quantity maximizes profit, and so deduce the corresponding supply curves. You should be warned, however, that if you make your curves too complicated, the computer may object; there is a limit to what machines will put up with.    If you are not sure how to draw a MC curve in such a way as to make it intersect AC several times, you may wish to leave this program entirely and experiment with program 1--Curvedraw. It lets you (among other things) draw a marginal cost curve and see the corresponding average cost curve drawn in simultaneously by the computer.                            (End of Supply Projects)
