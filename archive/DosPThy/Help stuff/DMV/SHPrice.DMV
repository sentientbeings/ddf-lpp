    A supply curve shows, for any price, how much of a good a firm chooses to sell if it can sell all it wants at that price. You are currently choosing a price in order to find a point on a supply curve--the point showing what quantity the firm would produce and sell at that price.    The price is shown on the screen as a horizontal line. You may, if you wish, think of that line as representing the (perfectly elastic) demand curve faced by a single firm on a competitive market, as explained at the beginning of Chapter 10. The firm can sell as much as it wishes without affecting the price.    You can adjust the price by using the up and down cursor keys (the ones with little arrows pointing up and down). If you have a mouse, you can also adjust it by putting the cursor above or below the price line and pressing the left mouse button to pull the line up or down. When you have the price you want, press the Enter key (or the right mouse button) and the program will go on to the next step.                              (End of Help Screen)
