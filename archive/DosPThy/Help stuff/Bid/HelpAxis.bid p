"    The axis tool is used to locate the X and Y coordinates  of a point (or the I and L coordinates if you are doing an Income/Leisure diagram). You select it by pressing the F5 function key. To use the tool, put the corner of ""the cursor over the point whose location you want (using the Cursor keys or the mouse to move the cursor). The coordinates of the point will appear just below the axis tool icon on the control panel. If you press down on  the ""Insert key, lines will appear from the corner of the cursor icon to the axes.      The lines disappear when you release the Insert key. If you wish them to ""remain after you release the button and move the cursor away, press the F5 key while holding down the Insert key.""                             (End of Axis Tool Help)"
