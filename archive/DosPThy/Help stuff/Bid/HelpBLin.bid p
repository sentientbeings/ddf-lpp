"    To use the budget line tool, first select it by pressing function key F3. Then move the cursor (using the cursor keys or the mouse) until it is as far right as the point on the x axis where you want the x intercept of your budget ""line and as high as the point on the y axis where you want the y intercept of your budget line. As you move it, values of Px,Py, and I for the budget line corresponding to the cursor's current position will appear on the control ""panel below the budget line icon.    These values are not unique; if, for example, you double your income and ""the prices of both x and y, the alternatives available to you will be the same as before, so you will still have the same budget line. The program holds one of the three variables (Px, Py, I) fixed while you draw your line and lets the ""other two vary. The locked variable is indicated by a row of three asterisks (***) next to it. To change which variable is locked, press F3.""    You may, if you wish, change the value of the locked variable by pressing the Scroll Lock key and then pressing the up or down cursor key. The locked variable will scroll up or down and the other two variables will change ""accordingly, so that the three variables together are always consistent with the current budget line. Press Scroll Lock again to turn it off so that the cursor keys can be used to move the cursor. If you have a mouse attached, you ""do not have to press Scroll Lock before using the cursor keys to scroll the variables.""    If you press down the shift key, the budget line will appear as a dotted line. You can move it by moving the cursor while holding the shift key down (or pressing and releasing Caps Lock or Insert, which sometimes works better ""as a way of locking shift down), or holding down the left mouse button if you have a mouse. Or you can just move the cursor, in which case the budget line will stay where it is until you again press shift (or the left mouse button)--""and will then jump to its new location.    When you finally have the budget line you want, press the Enter key (or ""the right mouse button). You will then be given an opportunity to label it with the current value of the `locked' variable. The label will appear on the budget line; it can be moved along it using the Cursor Keys (or pulled along ""it towards the cursor by pressing the left mouse button, if you have a mouse). If you do not want a label, press F3 to draw another budget line or press one of the other function keys to select another tool. If you do want the label, ""place it where you want it along the line then press Enter (or the right mouse button).""    The budget line tool may be used to put up to fifty different budget lines on the screen at one time. The variables shown will always correspond to the last budget line drawn.""                            (End of Budget Line Help)"
