"     Before using this program you should first read Chapter 3 of PRICE THEORY: AN INTERMEDIATE TEXT by David Friedman. After doing so you can use the program either to explore the ideas of the chapter on your own or to do ""problems assigned by your instructor. The following are some suggested projects.""    Project 1. Pick an indifference curve map and values for Px and Py and find the income expansion path; in other words, use the tools to determine how the individual's consumption of X and Y would vary as his income changed, ""prices held constant.    Project 2. For each of I1-I10 (or as many as you feel like trying), ""determine whether the indifference curves correspond to two normal goods, one normal and one inferior, or both inferior. As you should remember, a normal good is a good whose consumption increases with increasing income, an inferior ""good is one whose consumption decreases with increasing income.         Project 3. Pick an indifference curve map and values for I and Px and ""find the demand curve for Y; in other words, use the tools to find out how the individual's consumption of Y varies with its price, income and Px held constant. Then find the demand curve for X, income and Py held constant. ""     Project 4. See if any of the indifference curve maps corresponds to a Giffen good (a good whose consumption goes down when its price goes down--at ""least for some range of prices and income).    Project 5. Pick an indifference curve map and values for I, Px, Py. Find ""the optimal bundle. Next find the optimal bundle for the same I, Px but a different Py. Decompose the change from the first bundle to the second into an income effect and a substitution effect.""Projects 6-8 use the Income/Leisure version of the program, which is reached by choosing `Change Axes' from the Menu. Before doing these projects, you ""should read Chapter 5 of the text.    Project 6. Pick an indifference curve map and calculate the supply curve ""for labor of an individual whose tastes for income and leisure are represented by that map. Remember to draw budget lines for which income is zero when leisure is 24 hours/day.""    Project 7. Figure out what the variable A represents. You may find it useful to see for what sorts of budget lines A is positive, zero, and ""negative, and think about what real world situations such lines represent.     Project 8. Draw a series of budget lines, all of which have the same ""value of A. Calculate the corresponding labor supply curve. Repeat the process for several different values of A. What do these curves represent?""                                (End of Projects)"
