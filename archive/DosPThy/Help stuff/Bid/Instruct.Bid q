"     This program consists of a set of tools for drawing budget line/indifference curve diagrams. The right hand portion of the screen is the drawing area; the left hand portion contains the control panel for the tools. ""The program also provides the ability to save, load, and print the screens you draw. Instructions of several sorts (including the ones you are now reading) are available from inside the program.""     The tools can be used to draw many different kinds of budget line/indifference curve diagrams; you can get some suggestions by choosing ""`Projects' from the Help menu. You select a tool by pressing the corresponding function key (or, if you have a mouse, by moving the cursor over the icon for that tool and pressing one of the mouse buttons); the cursor on the drawing ""screen will change to match the icon representing that tool on the control panel.""     To use a tool, you must manipulate the cursor on the drawing area. It is controlled with the cursor keys on the keyboard or with a mouse if you have one. To start doing something with the tool you press one of the shift keys ""(or the left mouse button if you have a mouse). To finish doing something you press the Enter key (or the right mouse button).""                                    The Menus    When you select F1 (HELP) or F2(MENU) a set of alternatives appears on the ""screen. HELP lets you choose among four sorts of information: `Instructions' (what you are now reading), `Help' (detailed information on whatever tool you have just been using--or the Menu if you were using that when you chose ""Help),`Controls' (an explanation of how the keyboard and mouse are used to control the program) and `Projects' (a set of suggested projects to be done using the program). MENU lets you Quit, Start Over, Change Programs, Load""a previously saved screen, Save a screen, Print a screen, Change the Indifference curve map, Change the axes, or Change graphics (if your computersupports more than one kind).""                                Choice of Axes""    When the program first starts, the axes represent quantities of two goods, X and Y. In this form, it corresponds to the indifference curve figures of Chapter 3. By selecting `Change Axes' from the Menu, you can switch to a ""version of the program designed to show how a worker decides how many hours to work, trading off leisure against income. This version of the program corresponds to the Leisure/Income diagrams of Chapter 5. By choosing `Change ""Axes' again, you can return to the original version of the program. Changing versions wipes out anything you have drawn, so you may wish to save or print your current work first.""                                    The Tools""    The first tool is the budget line; it is selected with control key F3 and used to draw a budget line on the screen. As you draw the line, the values of I, Px, and Py (Io, W, and A in the Leisure/Income version of the program) ""corresponding to the line you are drawing are shown just below the budget line icon.""    The second tool, just below the box containing the budget line tool, is the indifference curve tool. It is used to show the indifference curve through any point. Before using this tool you will have to select one of the ten ""alternative indifference curve maps offered by the program. Your instructor may have told you to do a problem using a particular map; if not, you are free to experiment with whichever you wish.""    The third tool is the axis tool (F5); it is used to find the coordinates of a point by drawing lines from the point to the axes. The coordinates appear ""just below the icon.    The next three tools (F6, F7, F8) are used to mark points on the figure; ""they consist of an X, a square, and a circle. Below them are a line drawing tool (F9) and a tool for drawing freehand curves (F10).""    Below the drawing tools is a picture of the Backspace key. The backspace key is used to erase the last thing drawn with whatever tool is currently selected. To erase the entire screen and start over, use `Clear' from the file ""menu.                      (End of Instructions)"
