"     The Curve drawing tool (F10) is used to draw free-hand curves--you might, for example, use it to connect a set of points on an income expansion path. You start by moving the cursor to where you want the curve to start and ""pressing a shift key (or the left mouse button if you have a mouse). You then `pull the curve along' by moving the cursor and holding down shift (or use Caps Lock); if you have a mouse, use the left mouse button instead of the ""shift key.      If you wish, you can change to another tool while drawing the curve, then ""return and continue drawing. If you make a mistake in drawing the curve, you can `erase' it by using the Backspace Key. The curve will erase back from the end. ""     When you are satisfied with the curve, press Enter (or the right mouse button). The curve will become solid, and your cursor will be free to draw ""another curve. Once a curve has become solid erasing it will remove the whole curve, not just the last bit drawn.""      You can have a total of ten such curves on the screen at once; to draw an eleventh, you must first erase the tenth. The curves cannot exceed a maximum length; the program will tell you when you have `run out of curve.'""                            (End of Curve Tool Help)"
