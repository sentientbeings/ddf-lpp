    The indifference curve tool is used to display and draw indifference curves. Select it by pressing F4 (or clicking on its icon if you have a mouse). Then put the cursor anywhere on the drawing area of the screen and press a shift key (or left mouse button); the indifference curve through that point will appear. When you release the key, the indifference curve disappears. If you press Enter (or the right mouse button), the curve will be drawn in permanently.    Before using the indifference curve tool for the first time, you must choose one of ten alternative indifference maps, I1-I10. Each map is a set of indifference curves; if the screen were infinitely fine each would contain an infinite number of indifference curves, covering every point.     As you may discover, a particular selection from the setup menu does not always give you the same set of indifference curves; in some cases, after you make your selection, the computer rolls dice to choose some of the parameters defining the curves.     At any point in the program, you can press F2 to select MENU, press 7, and choose a new indifference curve map; doing so will automatically wipe out any indifference curves you have drawn with the old map.                          (End of Indifference Curve Help)
