    To use the budget line tool, first select it by pressing function key F3. Then move the cursor (using the mouse or the cursor keys) until it is as high as the point on the leisure axis where you want the horizontal intercept of your budget line (the quantity of leisure for which income is zero) and as far right as the point on the income axis where you want the vertical intercept of your budget line (your income if leisure equals zero).     As you move the cursor, values of Io, W, and A for the budget line corresponding to the cursor's current position will appear on the control panel below the budget line icon. Io is your income with zero leisure--what you would have if you worked 24 hours a day. W is your wage in dollars/hour. The meaning of the third parameter, A, is a problem for you to work out; doing so is one of the suggested projects.    If you press down the shift key, the budget line will appear as a dotted line. You can move it by moving the cursor while holding the shift key down (or pressing and releasing Caps Lock or Insert, which sometimes works better as a way of locking shift down), or holding down the left mouse button if you have a mouse. Or you can just move the cursor, in which case the budget line will stay where it is until you again press shift (or the left mouse button), then jump to its new location.    When you finally have the budget line you want, press the Enter key (or the right mouse button). You will then be given an opportunity to label it with the wage corresponding to that line. The label will appear on the budget line; it can be moved along it using the Cursor Keys (or pulled along it towards the cursor by pressing the left mouse button, if you have a mouse). If you do not want a label, press F3 to draw another budget line or press one of the other function keys to select another tool. If you do want the label, place it where you want it along the line then press Enter (or the right mouse button) to "print" the label onto the line.     In all of the situations discussed in Chapter 5, the horizontal intercept of the budget line was 24; if you took 24 hours a day of leisure, your income was zero. If you want to draw figures like those in Chapter 5, you should limit yourself to budget lines for which this is true. You may, however, find it interesting to experiment with budget lines with other intercepts, and try to figure out what real world situations they correspond to.    The budget line tool may be used to put up to fifty different budget lines on the screen at one time. The variables shown will always correspond to the last budget line drawn.             (End of Budget Line Help for the Labor/Leisure screen)
