      This program is controlled from the keyboard, using the function keys F1-F10, the number keys 1-10, the cursor keys, the shift keys, and the Enter key. If you have a mouse attached, the mouse is used instead of the cursor keys to move the cursor; the left and right mouse buttons substitute for shift and Enter.     The function keys, on an IBM PC and most compatibles, are located either at the left side of the keyboard or above the keyboard. In this program they are used to select either one of the two menus (HELP and MENU) or one of the eight tools. They may be used at almost any time in the program, except when you are in one of the menus. When you have selected HELP or MENU (F1 or F2) you cannot use the function keys to select either the other menu or a tool until you have made your selection and the computer has finished whatever you have told it to do. If you have selected MENU and wish information on the alternatives, choose"HELP" (9) from the Menu. You will be shifted to the HELP menu, where you can select Help (2) to get information about MENU. After you finish with the Help screen, you will be returned to MENU to make your choice.If you have a mouse, you can also choose tools and menus by moving the cursor to the corresponding Icon or menu name and pressing one of the mouse buttons.     The number keys, located at the top of the keyboard on an IBM PC and all of the compatibles with which I am familiar, are used to make selections from the menus and to choose an indifference curve map. On the IBM and most compatibles, you also have the alternative of pressing the Num Lock key and then using the numeric keypad located at the right side of the keyboard.  While this will work, it is not a good idea, since while Num Lock is down, the cursor keys on the numeric keypad cannot be used.     The cursor keys on a PC and most compatibles are on the numeric keypad; they are the same keys as the numbers 2,4,6, and 8. They function as cursor keys when Num Lock is off and number keys when it is on. Some compatibles have a light to show whether Num Lock is on; other computers, including the IBM PC, do not. If you find that the cursor keys are not having any effect, it may mean that Num Lock is on; if so, pressing it once will turn it off. Many computers also have a second set of cursor keys, which always work.      In this program, the Backspace key is used as an eraser; pressing it erases the most recent thing drawn with the currently selected tool. Pressing it again erases the next most recent thing drawn. By using it repeatedly with a succession of tools, you could erase everything--although it would be faster to go to MENU and select Clear.      The up and down cursors are used to scroll I, Px, or Py, whichever is currently locked. Their use is explained in more detail in the Help screen that you get by selecting the budget line tool (F3), then selecting HELP (F1) then Help (2).      If you do not have a mouse, the Cursor Keys are used to move the cursor around the screen. To move the cursor right, press the right cursor key (the one with a right arrow on it) and similarly for other directions.      Either shift key (or the left mouse button) can be used to make the cursor do things--make a mark with one of the marker tools, for example, or start the curve-drawing tool drawing a curve. If you want to hold down shift while moving the cursor, it may work better if you use caps lock or insert. Pressing and releasing either has the same effect as holding down the shift key; pressing and  releasing it again is like releasing the shift key. There is more detailed information on the use of shift (or the left mouse button) in the help screens for the various tools; to get any such screen, you simply select the tool then press F1 (HELP) then select 2 (Help).When reading help screens such as these, you can go up a page by pressing p (for Previous page) or PgUp; you can go down a screen by pressing n (for Next page) or PgDown. Pressing End takes you to the last page; pressing Home takes you to the first page.                                (End of Controls)
