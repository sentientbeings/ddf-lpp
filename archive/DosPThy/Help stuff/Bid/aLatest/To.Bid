    The menu (function key F2) shows a numbered list of alternatives. You choose an alternative by pressing the corresponding number key at the top of the keyboard (not the function key). You can QUIT (1), START OVER (2), CHANGE "PROGRAMS (3), LOAD a previously saved screen (4), SAVE your work in progress (5), PRINT your output (6), Choose a new indifference curve map (7) (which erases any indifference curves aleady drawn), CHANGE AXES from X/Y to Labor/Leisure or vice versa (8), CHANGE GRAPHICS if your computer supports more than one kind of graphics (9), Cancel and leave the menu (0), or get HELP (H).    If you select "Print" you should have a printer capable of printing graphics attached to your computer, turned on and on line. After you have pressed F2 (to select the file menu) and "6" (not F6) to select PRINT, you will be asked to type in your name. Do so. You will be asked to hold down the shift key and the "PrScr" key (it may be next to the right hand shift key). Do so. The printer will print an image of your screen, along with your name and some numbers describing the particular indifference curve map you are using. The latter are intended to provide information to your instructor when you hand in the sheet as part of your assignment.    If you select "Quit", you will find yourself back at the operating system level, with A> on the screen. You may then either run the program again by typing in BIDR and hitting the carriage return, or remove your disk, turn off the computer, and leave.    If you do not wish to make any of the choices, simply select "Cancel" (0) and you will be back with whatever tool you were using when you selected the menu.                            (End of Menu Help Screen)
