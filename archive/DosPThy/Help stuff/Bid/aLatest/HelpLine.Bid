     The line tool draws straight lines. Select it by pressing F9 (or moving your cursor over the line icon and pressing one of the mouse buttons--if you have a mouse). To use it, put the cursor where you want one end of your line to be, press shift (or the left mouse button), release, move the cursor to where you want the other end to be, and press shift (or the mouse button) again.       You can adjust the line by dragging an end. Move the cursor near the end you want to move and press the shift key (or left mouse button); the end of the line will move towards the cursor. When you are satisfied, press Enter (or the right mouse button). The line will become solid and you will be free to start another one if you wish. To cancel a line you are drawing, press F9 or switch to another tool. You can have up to twenty lines on the screen at once.                             (End of Line Tool Help)
