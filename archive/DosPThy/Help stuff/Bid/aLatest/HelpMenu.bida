1: Quit. This takes you out of the program and leaves you at the DOS level of the computer. Remove your disk or disks, turn off the computer, go home and take a nice warm bath. Close your eyes and watch the pretty indifference curves and budget lines.2: Start Over. This option wipes out everything you have done and starts over. 3: Change Programs. This option quits this program and takes you back to Control--the program from which you can choose to run any of the three programs. It also, of course, wipes out your current work (unless it has been saved to disk); if you come back to BIDR you will do so with a clean slate.4: Load. This option lets you load a budget line/indifference curve diagram from a disk--either one you have previously saved or one provided by your instructor. The program will ask you for the name of the file containing the diagram. The program assumes that all such files are on the current directory of the b drive of the computer. If you want to load a file from a different drive (or directory), you must include the drive specifier (or directory path) in the name of the file. For example, "a:first" would be a file named "first" located on drive a. If there is no disk in the drive, or if the file is not on the disk in that drive, you will be asked to check the drive, then given a chance to reenter the file name and try again. If you change your mind, you can abort loading by entering 'a' for the file name.5: Save. This option lets you save a diagram you have drawn to disk. Just as with Load, the program assumes you want to use disk drive b unless you specify a different drive in the name of the file. If there is no disk in the drive, or if it is write protected or full, or if for some other reason the program cannot save the program, you will be asked to check the drive then given a chance to reenter the name of the file. Enter 'a' to abort the save.  6: Print. This option lets you print a picture of the screen (plus some additional information, including your name) to a printer. You must have a printer capable of printing graphics; it is up to you (or your instructor) to make sure that the GRAPHICS.COM file for your printer is on your disk.The first time you print, the computer will ask you for your name; thereafter, it will continue to use the same name until you select Quit (1), Start Over (2), or Change Programs (3).  In order to print anything, your printer must be attached to the computer, turned on, and on line. If you try to print when any of these conditions is not met, the computer will tell you to check the printer then let you try again. 7: Change I curve. This option lets you change the indifference curve map you are using. It wipes out the indifference curves that were drawn with the old map.  8: Change Axes. The program originally comes up with X and Y axes representing two goods. Selecting this option switches to a version in which the axes represent income and leisure. If you are in the income/leisure version, selecting this option takes you back to the X/Y version. In either case, whatever you have drawn before making the change will be lost unless you have saved it to disk.9: Change Graphics. When the program starts, it checks your computer to see what graphics it supports. The program then chooses the highest resolution graphics available, in color if possible. This option lets you change that, by selecting any of the graphics standards that your computer (and the program) supports. The program supports CGA, DCGA (on AT&T and Olivetti, but not on Toshiba laptops), HGCA, EGA and VGA; it does not support super VGA. If your computer supports only one kind of graphics, option 9 will not be available.  0: Cancel. This option gets you back to the main part of the program.H: Help. This option gets you to where you now are.                              (End of Help Screen)
