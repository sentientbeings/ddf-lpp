"   The Eraser is used to erase things you have drawn. To use it, pressthe left cursor key--#4 on the numeric keypad. The last thing you have drawnwith the currently selected tool will be erased. By changing tools and then""pressing the left cursor key, you can erase anything you have drawn.     If you use the eraser key while you are drawing a freehand curve and""before you have finished the curve off, it will `roll back' the curve--starterasing it from the end you are drawing. If you use the eraser key after acurve is finished off, or after an unfinished curve has been completely""rolled back, it will erase the last finished curve.                              (End of Eraser Help)"
