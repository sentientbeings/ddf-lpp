"     This program consists of a set of tools for drawing budgetline/indifference curve diagrams. The right hand portion of the screen is the  drawing area; the left hand portion contains the control panel for the tools.""The program also provides the ability to save, load, and print the screensyou draw. Instructions of several sorts (including the ones you are nowreading) are available from inside the program.""     The tools can be used to draw many different kinds of budgetline/indifference curve diagrams; you can get some suggestions by choosing""`Projects' from the Help menu. You select a tool by pressing thecorresponding function key; the cursor on the drawing screen will change tomatch the icon representing that tool on the control panel.""     To use any tool, you must manipulate the icon cursor (`virtual mouse') onthe drawing area. It is controlled not with the cursor keys on the keyboard""(the keys on the numeric keyboard with arrows on them) but with its ownSpecial Cursor Keys. To move the virtual mouse left, press the left shift key(two buttons left of Z on most PC's). To move it up, press Ctrl (just above""the left shift). To move it down press Alt (just below the left shift). Tomove it right, press the right shift key.""     That seems like an unnecessarily complicated way of doing it, but, forreasons having to do with the PC's design, it makes it possible to move thevirtual mouse about twenty times faster than if the program used the cursor""keys. For similar reasons, you press the Insert key to signal the programthat you want it to do something.""                                    The Menus    When you select F1 (MENU) or F2(HELP) a set of alternatives appears on""the screen. MENU lets you Load a previously saved screen, Save a screen,Print a screen, Clear the screen and start over, Change the indifference curvemap, Change the axes, Change programs, or Quit the program. HELP allows you""to choose among four sorts of information: `Instructions' (what you are nowreading), `Help' (detailed information on whatever tool you have just beenusing--or the Menu if you were using that when you chose Help),`Controls' (an""explanation of how the keyboard is used to control the programs) and`Projects' (a set of suggested projects to be done using the program).""""                                Choice of Axes    When the program first starts, the axes represent quantities of two""goods, X and Y. In this form, it corresponds to the indifference curvefigures of Chapter 3. By selecting `Change Axes' from the Menu, you can switchto a version of the program designed to show how a worker decides how many""hours to work, trading off leisure against income. This version of theprogram corresponds to the Leisure/Income diagrams of Chapter 5. By choosing`Change Axes' again, you can return to the original version of the program.""Each time you change versions, you wipe out anything you have drawn under thecurrent version, so you may wish to save or print your current work first.""                                    The Tools    The first tool, in the box at the top of the control panel, is the""budget line; it is selected with control key F3 and used to draw a budget line on the screen. As you draw the line, the values of I, Px, and Py (Io, W,and A in the Leisure/Income version of the program) corresponding to the line""you are drawing are shown just below the budget line icon.""    The second tool, just below the box containing the budget line tool,is the indifference curve tool. It is used to show the indifference curvethrough any point. Before using this tool you will have to select one of the""ten alternative indifference curve maps offered by the program. Yourinstructor may have told you to do a problem using a particular map; if not,you are free to experiment with whichever you wish.""    The third tool, to the right of the indifference curve, is the axis tool(F5); it is used to find the coordinates of a point by drawing lines from""the point to the axes. The coordinates appear just below the icon.    The next three tools (F6, F7, F8) are used to mark  points on the""figure; they consist of an X, a _, and a white circle. Below them are a linedrawing tool (F9) and a tool for drawing freehand curves (F10).""    Below the drawing tools is a picture of the left arrow key (number 4 onthe numeric keypad--the left cursor control not the backspace key). It isused to erase the last thing drawn with whatever tool is currently selected. To""erase the entire screen and start over, use `Clear' from the file menu.                                                            (End of Instructions)"
