Youchoose an alternative from the list by pressing the corresponding number keyat the top of the keyboard (not the function key). You can LOAD a previously""save screen (1), SAVE your work in progress (2), PRINT your output (3), startover with a CLEAR screen (F4), Choose a new indifference curve map (5) (whichautomatically erases any indifference curves you have drawn using the old map),""QUIT the program (6), get HELP (7) or Cancel and leave the menu (0).    If you select `Print' you should have a printer capable of printing""graphics attached to your computer, turned on and on line.  After you havepressed F1 (to select the file menu) and `3' (not F3) to select PRINT, you willbe asked to type in your name. Do so. You will be asked to hold down the shift""key and the `PrScr' key (next to the right hand shift key). Do so. Theprinter will print an image of your screen, along with your name and some numbers describing the particular indifference curve  map you are using. The""latter are intended to provide  information to me when you hand in  the sheetas part of your assignment.""""    If you select 'Quit', you will find yourself back at  the operatingsystem level, with A> on the screen.  You may  then either run the  programagain by typing in BIDR and hitting the carriage return, or remove your disk,""turn off the computer, and leave.     If you do not wish to make any of the choices, simply select `Cancel' (0)""and you will be back with whatever tool you were using when you selected themenu.""                          (End of Menu Help Screen)"
