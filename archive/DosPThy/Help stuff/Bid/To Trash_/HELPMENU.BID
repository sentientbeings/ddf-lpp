"1: Load. This option lets you load a budget line/indifference curve diagramfrom a disk--either one you have previously saved or one provided by your instructor. The program will ask you for the name of the file containing the""diagram. The program assumes that all such files are on the b drive of thecomputer. If you want to load a file from a different drive, you must includethe drive specifier in the name of the file. For example, `a:first' would be a""file named `first' located on drive a. If there is no disk in the drive, orif the file is not on the disk in that drive, you will be asked to check thedrive, then given a chance to reenter the file name and try again. If you""change your mind, you can abort loading by entering 'a' for the file name.2: Save. This option lets you save a diagram you have drawn to disk. Just as""with Load, the program assumes you want to use disk drive b unless youspecify a different drive in the name of the file. If there is no disk in thedrive, or if it is write protected or full, or for some other reason the""program cannot save the program, you will be asked to check the drive thengiven a chance to reenter the name of the file. Enter 'a' to abort the save.""""3: Print. This option lets you print a picture of the screen (plus someadditional information, including your name) to a printer. You must have aprinter capable of printing graphics; it is up to you (or your instructor) to""make sure that the GRAPHICS.COM file for your printer is on your disk.The first time you print, the computer will ask you for your name; thereafter,""it will continue to use the same name until you select Clear (4), Change Axes(6), Change Programs (7) or Quit (8).""In order for you to print anything, your printer must be attached to thecomputer, turned on, and on line. If you try to print when any of theseconditions is not met, the computer will tell you to check the printer, then""give you a chance to try again.  4: Clear. This option wipes out everything you have done and starts over.""5: Change I curve. This option lets you change the indifference curve map youare using. It wipes out all of the indifference curves that were drawn with""the old map.""6: Change Axes. The program originally comes up with X and Y axesrepresenting two goods. Selecting this option switches to a version in whichthe axes represent income and leisure. If you are in the income/leisure""version, selecting this option takes you back to the X/Y version. In eithercase, whatever you have drawn before making the change will be eliminated,unless you have saved it to disk.""7: Change Programs. This option quits this program and takes you back toControl--the program from which you can choose to run any of the three""programs. It also, of course, wipes out your current work (unless it has beensaved to disk); if you come back to BIDR you will do so with a clean slate.""8: Quit. This takes you out of the program and leaves you at the DOS level ofthe computer. Remove your disk or disks, turn off the computer, go home andtake a nice warm bath. Close your eyes and watch the pretty indifference""curves and budget lines.9: Help. This option gets you to where you now are.""0: Cancel. This option gets you back to the main part of the program.                              (End of Help Screen)"
