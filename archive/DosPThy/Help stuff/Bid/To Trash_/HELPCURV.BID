"     The Curve drawing tool (F10) is used to draw free-hand curves to improvethe appearance of your screen; you might, for example, use it to connect a setof points on an income expansion path. You start drawing by moving the cursor""(using the Special Cursor Keys described in `Instructions' and `Controls'--left shift, right shift, Alt and Ctrl) to where you want the curve to startand pressing and releasing the Insert key. You then `pull the curve along' by""moving the cursor and holding down Insert. Sometimes the curve will get`stuck' and continue growing towards the cursor even though you have releasedthe insert key; this happens with some of the IBM compatible computers. If it ""happens, stop moving the cursor and press and release Insert to `let go' ofthe curve.""     If you wish, you can change to another tool while drawing the curve,then return and continue drawing. If you make a mistake in drawing the curve,you can `erase' it by using the eraser (left arrow key--number 4 on the numeric""keypad). The curve will erase back from the end.      When you are satisfied with the curve, press F10 again to finish it""off. The curve will become solider, and your cursor will be free to drawanother curve. Once a curve has become solid, erasing it will remove thewhole curve, not just the last bit drawn.""     You can have a total of ten such curves on the screen at once; if youwant to draw an eleventh, you must first erase the tenth. The curves cannotexceed a maximum length; the program will tell you when you have `run out of""curve.'                            (End of Curve Tool Help)"
