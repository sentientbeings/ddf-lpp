"    To use the budget line tool, first select it by pressing function keyF3. Then move the cursor (using the Special Cursor Control keys describedin`Instructions' and `Controls'--left shift, right shift, Alt and Ctrl) until""its horizontal coordinate represents the point on the leisure axis where youwant the horizontal intercept of your budget line (the quantity of leisure forwhich income is zero) and its vertical coordinate represents the point on the""income axis where you want the vertical intercept of your budget line (yourincome if leisure equals zero). ""    As you move the cursor, values of Io, W, and A for the budget linecorresponding to the cursor's current position will appear on the control panelbelow the budget line icon. Io is your income with zero leisure--what you""would have if you worked 24 hours a day. W is your wage in dollars/hour. Themeaning of the third parameter, A, is a problem for you to work out; doing sois one of the suggested projects.""    When you think you have the budget line you want, press the Insert key.Release it. The budget line will appear on the screen. As you continue to""move the cursor, the budget line will change accordingly. As you change thebudget line, the corresponding values of Io, W, and A will be displayed on thecontrol panel. Press and release Insert again when you are finished.""    In all of the situations discussed in Chapter 5, the horizontal interceptof the budget line was 24; if you took 24 hours a day of leisure, your incomewas zero. If you want to draw figures like those in Chapter 5, you should""limit yourself to budget lines for which this is true. You may, however, findit interesting to experiment with budget lines with other intercepts, and tryto figure out what real world situations they correspond to.""    When you have finished drawing the budget line, you will be given anopportunity to label it with the wage corresponding to that line. The label""will appear on the budget line; it can be moved along it using the SpecialCursor Keys. If you do not want a label, press F3 to draw another budget lineor press one of the other function keys to select another tool. If you do wantthe label, use the Special Cursor Keys to place it where you want it along theline, then press Insert to `print' the label onto the line.""    The budget line tool may be used to put up to fifty different budgetlines on the screen at one time. The variables shown will always correspondto the last budget line drawn. While adjusting a budget line you can, if""you wish, select another tool, use it, and then return to the budget line.                (End of Budget Line Help for the Labor/Leisure screen)"
