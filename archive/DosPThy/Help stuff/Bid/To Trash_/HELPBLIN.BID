"    To use the budget line tool, first select it by pressing function key F3.Then move the cursor (using the Special Cursor Keys described in `Instructions'and `Controls'--left shift, right shift, Alt and Ctrl) until its x coordinate""is the point on the x axis where you want the x intercept of your budget lineand the y coordinate is the point on the y axis where you want the y interceptof your budget line. As you move it, values of Px,Py, and I for the budget line""corresponding to the cursor's current position will appear on the controlpanel below the budget line icon.""    When you think you have the budget line you want, press the Insert key.Release it. The budget line will appear on the screen. If you move the cursor,the budget line will change accordingly and the corresponding income and ""prices will be displayed on the control panel under the budget line icon.Press and release Insert again when you are finished. ""     These values are not unique; if, for example, you double your income andthe prices of both x and y, the alternatives available to you will be the sameas before, so you will still have the same budget line. The program holds one""of the three variables (Px, Py, I) fixed while you draw your line, and letsthe other two vary. The locked variable is indicated by a row of threeasterisks (***) next to it. To change which variable is locked, press F3. ""     You may , if you wish, change the value of the locked variable by pressing the up or down cursor key on the keyboard (the real cursor key thistime--number 8 or 2 on the numeric keypad). The locked variable will scroll up""or down and the other two variables will change accordingly, so that thethree variables together are always consistent with the current budget line.""     When you have pressed Insert the second time, to indicate that you aresatisfied with your budget line, you will be given an opportunity to label thebudget line with the current value of the `locked' variable. The label will""appear on the budget line; it can be moved along it using the Special CursorKeys. If you do not want a label, press F3 to draw another budget lineor one of the other function keys to select another tool. If you do want the""label, use the Special Cursor Keys to locate it where you want it along theline, then press the insert key to `print' the label onto the line.""    The budget line tool may be used to put up to fifty different budgetlines on the screen at one time. The variables shown will always correspond tothe last budget line drawn. While adjusting a budget line you can, if you""wish, select another tool, use it, and then return to the budget line.                            (End of Budget Line Help)"
