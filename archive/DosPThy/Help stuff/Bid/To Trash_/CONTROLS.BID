"      This program is controlled from the keyboard, using four groups ofkeys: the function keys F1-F10, the number keys 1-10, the ordinary cursorcontrol keys, and the Special Cursor Control Keys.""     The function keys, on an IBM PC and on many of the compatibles, arelocated at the left side of the keyboard. In this program, they are used""to select either one of the two menus (MENU and HELP) or one of the eighttools. They may be used at almost any time in the program, except when you arein one of the two menus. When you have selected MENU or HELP (F1 or F2) you""cannot use the function keys to select either the other menu or a tool untilyou have made your selection and the computer has finished whatever you havetold it to do. If you have selected MENU and wish information on the""alternatives, choose`HELP' (9) from the Menu. You will be shifted to the HELPmenu, where you can select Help (2) to get information about MENU. After youfinish with the Help screen, you will be returned to MENU to make your choice.""     The number keys, located at the top of the keyboard on an IBM PC and allof the compatibles with which I am familiar, are used to make selections from""the menus and to choose an indifference curve map. On the IBM and mostcompatibles, you also have the alternative of pressing the Num Lock key andthen using the numeric keypad located at the right side of the keyboard. ""While this will work, it is not a good idea, since while Num Lock is down,the cursor keys cannot be used.""     The cursor keys on a PC and most compatibles are on the numerickeypad; they are the same keys as the numbers 2,4,6, and 8. They function ascursor keys when Num Lock is off and number keys when it is on. Some""compatibles have a light to show whether Num Lock is on; other computers,including the IBM PC, do not. If you find that the cursor keys are not havingany effect, it may mean that Num Lock is on; if so, pressing it once will turn""it off.     In this program, the left cursor key (4 on the numeric keypad) is used""as an eraser; pressing it erases the most recent thing drawn with thecurrently selected tool. Pressing it again erases the next most recent thingdrawn. By using it repeatedly with a succession of tools, you could erase""everything--although it would be faster to go to MENU and select Clear.     The up and down cursors (8 and 2) are used to scroll I, Px, or""Py,whichever is currently `locked.' Their use is explained in more detail inthe Help screen that you get by selecting the budget line tool (F3), thenselecting HELP (F2) then Help (2).""     The Special Cursor Keys are used in this program to move the cursoraround the screen and make it do things. To move the cursor right, press theright shift key; it is located next to ?, at the right hand end of the bottom""row of letters on the keyboard of an IBM PC. To move the cursor left, pressthe left shift key, usually located next to \ at the left hand end of thebottom row of letters. To move the cursor up press Ctrl, located just above the""left shift; to move the cursor down, press Alt, located just below the leftshift. ""     The Insert key is used in this program to make the cursor dothings--make a mark with one of the marker tools, for example, or start thecurve-drawing tool drawing a curve. It is located just below and to the right""of the right hand shift key on the standard keyboard. More detailedinformation on its use will be found in the help screens for the various tools;to get any such screen, you simply select the tool then press F2 (HELP) then""select 2 (Help).                                (End of Controls)"
