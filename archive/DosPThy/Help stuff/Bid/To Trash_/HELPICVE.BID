"    The indifference curve tool is used to display and draw indifferencecurves. Select it by pressing F4. If you then put the cursor anywhere on thedrawing area of the screen and press the Insert key, the indifference curve""through that point will appear. When you release the key, the indifference curve will disappear. If you press F4 again while holding down Insert, thecurve will be drawn in. ""   Before using the indifference curve tool for the first time, you must chooseone of ten alternative sorts of indifference maps, I1-I10. Each map is a set""of indifference curves; if the screen were infinitely fine each wouldcontain an infinite number of indifference curves, covering every point on thescreen.  As you may discover, a particular selection from the setup menu does""not always give you the same set of indifference curves; in some cases,after you make your selection, the computer randomly picks values for some ofthe parameters defining the curves.""     At any point in the program, you can press F1 to select MENU, press 5,and choose a new indifference curve map; doing so will automatically wipe out""any indifference curves you have drawn with the old map.                        (End of Indifference Curve Help)"
