"   To erase things you have drawn, press the Backspace key. The last thing you have drawn with the currently selected tool will be erased. By changing tools and then pressing Backspace, you can erase anything you have drawn.""     If you use Backspace while drawing a freehand curve, it will roll back the curve--start erasing it from the end you are drawing. If you use Backspace ""after a curve is finished off, or after an unfinished curve has been completely rolled back, it will erase the last finished curve.""                              (End of Eraser Help)"
