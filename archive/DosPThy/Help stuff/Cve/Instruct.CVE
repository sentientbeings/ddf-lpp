    This program helps you to explore the relationship among total, average, and marginal curves. The first step is to decide which kind of curves you are interested in--cost curves, revenue curves, or value curves. Next you decide which curve you wish to draw; if, for example, you have chosen cost curves, you must decide whether to draw total cost, marginal cost, or average cost. As you draw the curve on the screen, the computer can draw in one or both of other curves; it is up to you to tell it which curves, if any, you wish it to draw.    Once all the decisions are made, axes and an arrow shaped cursor appear on the screen. You control the cursor using the cursor keys (or a mouse, if you have one attached to your computer). If you press shift (or the left mouse button), the curve you are drawing will grow towards the cursor and the computer will simultaneously draw in the curves it is drawing. The vertical axis represents what is being graphed; the horizontal axis is quantity.    After you finish drawing the curve, you will be given the opportunity to see any subset of the three curves redrawn. If, for example, you drew TC and had the computer draw MC, you might ask to see MC and AC. The computer would clear the drawing area and redraw the axes along with the MC and AC implied by the TC you originally drew. When you finish looking at as many subsets as you like, you will be returned to the beginning of the program.    The idea is to use the computer to experiment with the relationship among the different curves. You can do something to one curve and see how it affects one or both of the others. This should help you learn to understand what total, marginal, and average curves are and how they are connected.    At any point in the program, you may press the function key F1 at the upper left corner of the keyboard or the function key F2 next to it. F1 is the Help key. It offers you Instructions, Help, Controls, or Projects. Instructions gives you an overview of the entire program (what you are reading now). Help gives you specific instructions for the part of the program you are currently in. Controls explains, in more detail than Help or Instructions, how you use the mouse and various keys on the keyboard to control the program. Projects contains suggested projects to do, using the program. Which suggestions you get when you choose Projects depends on which group of curves you are currently working with.    F2 offers a menu of alternatives, including changing programs, starting over, changing graphics (provided your computer supports more than one type of graphics), and quitting; you choose by striking the corresponding number (not function) key.*************************************************************************** ******                           NOTICE                            ******** *****                                                                ****** **** Nothing you can do to this computer, short of taking a hammer to  **** **** it, will do any permanent damage; you can always turn it off and  **** **** start over.
