    You are currently choosing which of three curves you wish to draw  and which you wish the computer to draw. The three curves are Total Revenue (TR), Marginal Revenue (MR) and Demand (D). Demand is the same thing as Average Revenue, since the demand curve shows the price corresponding to a given quantity and the price you sell your goods for is equal to your average revenue. If you sell 100 oranges at $2/orange, you receive $200; average revenue is $200/100 oranges=$2/orange.    You choose a curve to draw by striking the appropriate number key: 1 for TR, 2 for MR, 3 for D. Do not confuse the number keys (1-9, 0) with  the function keys (F1-F10).    After you make your selection, the computer will ask which of the other curves you wish it to draw. You may select one, both, or neither. You select a curve by striking the corresponding number key; you unselect it (if you make a mistake or change your mind) by pressing the same key again. When a curve is selected, an X appears next to it; when it is unselected, the X disappears.    When you are satisfied with your selection, press 0 (the number zero, not the letter O).                                                       (End of Help Screen)
