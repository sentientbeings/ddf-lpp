This screen does not exist; nowhere in the book do we consider a consumer for whom the value he receives from consuming a good does not go to zero as the quantity of the good consumed goes to zero, so the program does not let you graph a total value curve which has "fixed value." You might want to try to think up some plausible real-world situation in which that happens, and work out the implications for yourself. That should be a trivial project for someone enterprising enough to list the help screens on the disk.                            (End of Help Screen)
