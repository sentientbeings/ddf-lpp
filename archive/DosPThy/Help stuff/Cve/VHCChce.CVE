    You are currently choosing which of two curves you wish to draw and which you wish the computer to draw. The curves are Total Value (TV) and Marginal Value (MV). You choose a curve to draw by striking the appropriate number key: 1 for TV, 2 for MV. Do not confuse the number keys, which are the top row of the main group of keys on the keyboard of an IBM PC (and most compatibles), with the function keys (F1-F10), which are typically located at the left or top of the keyboard.    After you make your selection, the computer will ask which of the other curves you wish it to draw; since there is only one curve left, it is really asking whether or not you want it to draw the other curve. If you do, strike the number key 1 to select the other curve; if you have made a mistake or changed your mind, you can unselect it by pressing the key again. When a curve is selected, an X appears next to it; when it is unselected, the X disappears.    When you are satisfied with your selection, press 0 (the number zero, not the letter O).                                                         (End of Help Screen)
