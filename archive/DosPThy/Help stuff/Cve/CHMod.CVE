You are currently choosing which of three sorts of curves you wish to draw--cost, revenue, or value curves. Cost curves are explained in some detail in Chapter 9 of the text (The text is Price Theory: An Intermediate Text, by David Friedman--as you should know unless you are running a pirated copy of this program). Revenue curves are discussed in Chapter 10 and value curves in Chapter 4.    As you will soon learn, if you do not already know, the relation between total, marginal, and average curves is the same whether we are talking about cost, revenue, or value. There are, however, a number of differences in detail according to which you pick, such as whether or not there is a fixed term and what the curves are called.    You make your choice by striking one of the number keys; they are the top row of the main group of keys on the keyboard. They are not the same as the function keys (F1-F10), which are usually either to the left of the main group of keys or above them. Strike 1 if you want to draw cost curves, 2 if you want to draw revenue curves, and 3 if you want to draw value curves. The program will then let you choose which particular curve you want to draw.                                (End of Help Screen)
