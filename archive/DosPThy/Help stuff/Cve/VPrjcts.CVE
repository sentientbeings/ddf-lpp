    Try experimenting with the curves to answer the following questions:1: What do you have to do, when drawing marginal value, to make total value increase? Decrease? Stay constant?2: What do you have to do, when drawing total value, to make marginal value increase, decrease, or stay constant?3: What does the slope of total value tell you about marginal value? What does the height of marginal value tell you about total value? 4: For some goods, total value reaches or approaches a limit. I cannot get an infinite value from an infinite number of oranges; my stomach is not big enough. (Dennis the Menace, with a queasy expression, pointing at a cookie jar: "Mommy said I could eat as many as I wanted, but I can't"). What does such a situation imply about the marginal value curves for such goods?5: For some goods, there is a quantity beyond which increased consumption makes us worse off. What would that imply about their marginal value curves?                                (End of Projects)
