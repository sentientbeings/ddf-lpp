    Before you draw cost curves, you must first tell the computer what fixed cost is going to be. Fixed cost, as you should already know, is the value of total cost at a quantity of zero, so it is the height on the vertical axis at which the total cost curve will start.    Fixed cost is shown in a box at the bottom of the left hand side of the screen. If you want to increase it, press the up cursor key (marked by an up arrow); FC will keep increasing as long as you keep the key pressed. If you want to decrease it, press the down cursor key. When you have the value of fixed cost that you want, press Enter and the computer will go on to the next step in the program.                          (End of Help Screen)
