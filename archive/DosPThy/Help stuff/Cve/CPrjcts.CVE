     Try experimenting with the curves to answer the following questions:1: What do you have to do, when drawing marginal cost, to make total cost increase? Decrease? Stay constant?2: What do you have to do, when drawing total cost, to make marginal cost increase, decrease, or stay constant?3: What do you have to do, when drawing marginal cost, to make average cost stay constant? Increase? Decrease?4: When drawing average cost, what do you have to do with it in order to make marginal cost stay constant? Does the answer depend on the relative position of the two curves? 5: When drawing average cost, try making it rise, then fall, then rise again. What happens to marginal cost? Why?6: When drawing total cost, what do you have to do in order to make average cost stay constant? Increase? Decrease?7: When drawing average cost, what do you have to do in order to make total cost stay constant? Increase? Decrease? Can you explain why?  8: How does your choice of fixed cost affect the average cost curve? Can you explain why?     You may find it useful to remember that total cost is shown on one vertical axis and marginal and average cost on the other because they are in different units; total cost is in (say) dollars (or dollars/year) while marginal and average cost are in dollars/widget. A statement such as "total cost equals (or is greater than or is less than) marginal cost" is meaningless, just as the statement "that table is longer than it is heavy" would be meaningless. Marginal and average cost are in the same units, so a statement such as "marginal cost equals average cost" is not meaningless.     The curves are all functions of quantity, which is on the horizontal axis, so a statement such as "total cost starts increasing just where (i.e. at the quantity at which) average cost starts decreasing" is not meaningless (although that particular statement happens to be false).                                (End of Projects)
