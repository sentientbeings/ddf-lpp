    You have just drawn one revenue curve; while you did so, the computer calculated the other two curves implied by the one you drew. You can now look at the curves again, in any combination you wish. Simply select one, two, or three of the curves, and the computer will clear the screen and redraw it with the curves you have selected.    To select a curve, strike the corresponding number key (not the function key). To unselect it, strike the key again. Any curve that is selected will have an X next to it. When you are satisfied with your selections, press 0 (the number zero, not the letter O). The computer will draw the curves. You may repeat the procedure of choosing a selection of curves and having the computer draw them as many times as you like. When you are finished, simply answer no (press the key "n") when the computer asks if you want to see a different selection of curves. You will be returned to the beginning of the program, where you can again select a type of curve (cost, revenue, or value) and a specific curve to draw. If you want to exit the program or to switch to a different program, press F2 (MENU) after you have finished with this help screen and returned to the program.                                (End of Help Screen)
