    You are currently choosing which of three curves you wish to draw  and which you wish the computer to draw. The three curves are Total Cost (TC), Marginal Cost (MC) and Average Cost (AC). You choose to draw one of them by striking the appropriate number key. Number keys are the top row of the main group of keys on the keyboard of an IBM PC and most compatibles. Do not press the function keys (F1-F10), which are usually at either the left or the top of the keyboard, unless you want the HELP (F1) or MENU (F2). Strike 1 to choose to draw TC, 2 for MC, and 3 for AC.    After you make your selection, the computer will ask which of the other curves you wish it to draw. You may select one, both, or neither. You select a curve by pressing the corresponding number key; you deselect it (if you make a mistake or change your mind) by pressing the same key again. When a curve is selected, an X appears next to it; when it is deselected, the X disappears.    When you are satisfied with your selection of curves for the computer to draw, press 0 (the number zero, not the letter O). The program will then go on to the next stage, at which you draw a curve while the computer simultaneously draws the other curves corresponding to it.                              (End of Help Screen)
