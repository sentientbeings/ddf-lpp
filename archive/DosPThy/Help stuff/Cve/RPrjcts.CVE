    Try experimenting with the curves to answer the following questions:1: What do you have to do, when drawing marginal revenue, to make total revenue increase? Decrease? Stay constant?2: What do you have to do, when drawing total revenue, to make marginal revenue increase, decrease, or stay constant?3: What sort of demand curve corresponds to a horizontal marginal revenue curve? What economic situation does this represent?4: The program will not let you draw a rising demand curve. Is it possible, by drawing either total or marginal revenue, to force the computer to draw a rising demand curve?5. Marginal, total and average revenue are functions of quantity, but the demand curve shows quantity demanded as a function of price. Can you force the computer to draw an average revenue curve that cannot possibly be a demand curve--not merely because it slopes up, but because it has two different values for the same price? If so, can you restate more precisely my claim (made in one of the Help screens) that average revenue and demand are the same? 6: When drawing demand, what do you have to do in order to make total revenue stay constant? Increase? Decrease? Can you explain why? You may find the discussion of elasticity in Chapter 10 useful.       Remember that total revenue is shown on one vertical axis and marginal revenue and price (the vertical coordinate of the demand curve) on the other because they are in different units; total revenue is in dollars (or dollars/year) while marginal revenue and demand are in dollars/widget. A statement such as "total revenue equals (or is greater than or is less than) marginal revenue" is meaningless, just as the statement "that stone is longer than it is heavy" would be meaningless. Marginal revenue and price are in the same units, so a statement such as "the marginal revenue curve is above the demand curve"is not meaningless.    The curves are all functions of quantity, shown on the horizontal axis, so a statement such as "total revenue starts increasing just where demand starts decreasing" is not meaningless, although that particular statement happens to be false.                                (End of Projects)
