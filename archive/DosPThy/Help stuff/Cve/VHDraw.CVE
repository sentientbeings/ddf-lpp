    You draw a curve (TV or MV) by using the cursor keys (or the mouse if you have a mouse) to move the cursor and the shift key (or left mouse button) to drag the line in the direction of the cursor. The first step is to move the cursor until it is at the height where you want the curve to start. If you draw TV it will start at 0; if you draw MV it will start at the height of the cursor.    To start the curve, press shift (or the left mouse button), and the curve will start growing from the vertical axis towards the cursor. As long as you hold down shift (or the left mouse button), the curve will grow towards the cursor; if you release it, the curve stops growing. You can then move the cursor and press shift again; the curve will start growing towards the new position.         You can also move the cursor while holding shift down; the curve will follow the cursor across the screen. This may work better if, instead of holding down shift, you press Shift Lock, which in effect locks down the shift key. To release it, press Shift Lock again.    You can only draw from left to right; if you try moving the cursor behind (to the left of) the end of the line you are drawing, the line will stop growing. If the curve doubled back--went first left to right and then right to left--there would be some quantities for which it had two different values. That is impossible; TV and MV are functions of quantity, so they cannot have two values at the same quantity.     As you draw the curve, the computer will simultaneously draw in the other curve (assuming you told it to). To help you distinguish the two curves, the computer shows, at the left side of the screen, the type of line used for each. To keep you from getting confused about which curve you are drawing, it is marked with a star at the growing end.    When you have finished drawing the curve, press Enter (or the right mouse button).                               (End of Help Screen)
