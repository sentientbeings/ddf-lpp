    You have just drawn either a total value or a marginal value curve; while you did so, the computer calculated the other curve implied by the one you drew. You can now look at either one of the curves separately, or both together. Select one or both of the curves, and the computer will clear the screen and redraw it with the curve or curves you have selected.    To select a curve, strike the corresponding number key (not the function key). To unselect it, press the key again. Any curve that is selected will have an X next to it. When you are satisfied with your selections, strike 0 (the number zero, not the letter O). The computer will draw the curves. You may repeat the procedure of choosing a curve or curves and having the computer draw them as many times as you like. When you are finished, simply answer no (strike the key "n") when the computer asks if you want to see a different selection of curves. You will be returned to the beginning of the program, where you can again select a type of curve (cost, revenue, or value) and a specific curve to draw. If you want to exit the program or to switch to a different program, press F2 (MENU) after you have finished with this help screen and returned to the program.                                  (End of Help Screen)
