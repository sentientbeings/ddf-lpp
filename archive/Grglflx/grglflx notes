grglﬂxThis is a nice combination of game and teaching tool. I couldn’t make it crash but have some suggestions.1. The help & instruction windows should use 12 point type, not 9 point, and should have a zoom box.2. The text in these windows is not properly responsive to the scroll bar—or, rather, it is oddly responsive. Sometimes moving the thumb down has no effect on the text; sometimes a small movement in the thumb takes you straight to the end. And the window does not display all the text! The “instructions” window quits at “After a thousand years”.3. There should be icl8s and other stuff for System 7.0. Maybe some color, if only in the borders and text.4. Change the sounds. Your voice gets tiresome. Other possible sounds (music) as options, at a minimum.5. The scores should be stored in a scores ﬁle, not in the application. Don’t force constant re-backup of program ﬁles. (Anyway, writing to an application invites crashes.)6. Allow constant re-play without hitting “Go” repeatedly.7. Larger windows on big screens.8. An explanation, somewhere, of the algorithms.9. Starting number of points seems random. Is it? I’ve gotten to same level, shoosing at the same time, with scores off by factor of two (e.g., 1500 high, 750 low for failing at level 6).Frank
